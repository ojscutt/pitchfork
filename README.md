# pitchfork
*rapid emulation of individual radial modes of solar like oscillators using a branching neural network*
---
Accurately measuring the ages and internal structures of stars is tough!
We can use individual asteroseismic modes of oscillation to improve precision, but typically this comes at a hefty computational cost when interpolating grids to high dimenstions.
In this repo we present *pitchfork* - a branching multilayer perceptron capable of rapidly emulating the indivudual radial modes of a grid of solar-like oscillators.
For the remainder of this README, I'll present the relevant info regarding the training data for pitchfork and our prediction accuracy on a test set.
Then, we can take a look at the `inference-example.ipynb` notebook to go over our process of stellar parameter inference.
Hope you enjoy!
